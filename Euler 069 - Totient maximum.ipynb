    "**Explanation:**  n/φ(n) is equal to the product of p/(p-1) for all distinct prime divisors of n.\n",
    "We may assume that n has no repeated prime factors (i.e. is square free), because repeating a prime factor would increase the value of n without changing the value of n/φ(n). We may also assume that the prime factors are consecutive, because replacing one prime with a smaller prime would increase the product.\n",
