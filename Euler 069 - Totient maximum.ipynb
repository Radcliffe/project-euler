      "**Explanation:**  n/\u03c6(n) is equal to the product of p/(p-1) for all distinct prime divisors of n.\n",
      "We may assume that n has no repeated prime factors (i.e. is square free), because repeating a prime factor would increase the value of n without changing the value of n/\u03c6(n). We may also assume that the prime factors are consecutive, because replacing one prime with a smaller prime would increase the product.\n",
      "So the answer is the largest product of consecutive primes (starting at 2) that is less than 1,000,000."
